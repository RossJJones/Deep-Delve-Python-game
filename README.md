# Deep-Delve-Python-game
A basic dungeon crawler game I made in Python for my A-Level course work.
Please place all the image folders into a new folder called Deep Delve and place this in the same directory as the .py file.
More instructions are marked inside the .py file.
Pygame is needed to run this game, but the code can be viewed without it using python IDLE.
